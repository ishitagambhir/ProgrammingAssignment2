## This function caches the inverse of a matrix instead
## of computing it repeatedly.

## default value is a matrix. We need to assign a default
## value so that cacheSolve can be executed without an error.

	## of the inverse that has previously been calculated in m
	## by cacheSolve can be cleared.

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by

## because the $ extract operator won't work otherwise.
